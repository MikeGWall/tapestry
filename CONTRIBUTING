stay tuned, as per the opensource.guide/starting-a-project, I plan to include information on:
"  
How to file a bug report (try using issue and pull request templates)
How to suggest a new feature
How to set up your environment and run tests"  and
The types of contributions we are looking for
Our roadmap or vision for the project
How contributors should (or should not) get in touch with you
How contributions are to be credited
